Glorified file copier, but it's RAD 
# PFAQ
(Probably Frequently Asked Questions)
## Program is not able to find UWP Roblox
This program only works on Microsoft Store Roblox, install it and run the program.
## Sounds folder is empty
You have to join a game on UWP Roblox first, and to get all the sounds, wait for the game to load.
## Sounds from different games are in the sounds folder
Close UWP Roblox. Then, navigate to where all the tray icons are, right click on the Roblox Audio Downloader logo, and left click "Clear Audio Cache."
## Why can't I find (insert sound effect here)?
Sounds are only put on disk if they are greater than about 500 KB, the sound effect you are looking for is too small.
## Where is the latest release/how to install?
Just download and run [the program](https://github.com/HarryBlueJay/Roblox-Audio-Downloader/raw/main/Release/Roblox%20Audio%20Downloader.exe) anywhere*, required folders will be created, and it will restart once.
### How to update?
Just download and run a more recent version of the program anywhere*, and it will have updated.</br>

**\*Anywhere excluding the program directory (%localappdata%\Roblox Audio Downloader) or any path including "coding time\\C++\\Roblox Audio Downloader"**
